This is my latest project on excel.

Objective - To create an interactive road accident dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so as to get required insights.

Steps Followed - 

1. Data cleaning - cheaking errors and duplicates
2. Data transformation - created new columns
3. Created different pivot tables
4. Created differnt charts such as donut chart, line chart, tree map etc
5. Added Filter and Slicer

Key Performance Indicators-

1. Total casualties takes place after accident.
2. Total casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
3. Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type.

This is a complete dynamic and interactive dashboard in which user can use filter and slicers to see data accordingly. There is also link attached to all the pivot tables used for making charts.

This dashboard will help raise awareness about road safety issues and will also help all stakeholders to make data driven and informed decisions to make our roads safer.
